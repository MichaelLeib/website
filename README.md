   - Professional experience
   - Projects and achievements

## üé® Customization

### Personal Information

Update the personal information in `src/app/services/cv-data.service.ts`:

```typescript
personalInfo: {
  name: 'Your Name',
  title: 'Your Title',
  email: 'your.email@example.com',
  linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile',
  github: 'https://github.com/yourusername',
  location: 'Your Location'
}
```

### Favicon

A custom favicon is included by default, featuring a modern Angular logo with a blue gradient and glass morphism effect to match the site's style. This favicon is provided in both SVG (`src/favicon.svg`) and PNG (`src/favicon-32x32.png`) formats for maximum browser compatibility. Modern browsers will use the SVG, while older browsers will fall back to the PNG or ICO.

To change the favicon:

1. Replace `src/favicon.svg` with your own SVG (recommended for best quality)
2. Optionally update `src/favicon-32x32.png` and `src/favicon.ico` for legacy support
3. Update the `<link rel="icon" ...>` tags in `src/index.html` if you use a different filename or format

### Design System

The design system uses CSS custom properties defined in `src/styles.scss`:

- Colors and gradients
- Spacing and typography
- Glass morphism effects
- Animation timings

### Components

- `AboutSectionComponent` - About me section with stats
- `SkillsSectionComponent` - Skills with animated progress bars
- `ExperienceSectionComponent` - Professional timeline
- Additional components can be added as needed
